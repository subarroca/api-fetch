# API FETCH

## Requirements

* UI
* API Fetch from local data (but having in mind external in future)
* Dropdown to chose request method
* No libraries except for syntax highlight
* Performance
* Testable

## To run

```
npm i
webpack
```


## Improvements

* ~~Use babel to move es6/7 code to es5~~
* Add a minifier to compact the code
* Add sass so stylesheets support variables in all browsers
* Move index outside of dist and copy via npm
